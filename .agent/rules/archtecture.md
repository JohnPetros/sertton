# Architecture & Patterns Context
ALWAYS read the file `documentation/architecture.md` as the primary source of truth before:
1. Answering questions about the project structure.
2. Generating code for new features (UI, Core, Rest, or Drivers).
3. Refactoring existing classes.
4. Explaining design patterns (MVP, DTOs, Mappers, Repository).

you MUST follow the specific stack definitions found in this file (Riverpod, Signals, Dio, Clean Architecture).
